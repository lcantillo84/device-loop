                        At DeviceLoop, we used to stare at our overflowing tech drawers — old phones, tablets, and laptops we’d outgrown but couldn’t bear to toss.
                        That question — “Could these do more than gather dust?” — led us here.

                        DeviceLoop turns your forgotten gadgets into real-world impact. We refurbish them for a second life or reuse their materials responsibly.
                        Even better, for every device you send, we plant a tree. That’s our loop: from e-waste to ecosystem.

                        Imagine this: your old phone helps someone stay connected, avoids the landfill, saves CO₂ — and becomes a literal tree.
                        We’re building a movement where reuse and regeneration go hand in hand.
